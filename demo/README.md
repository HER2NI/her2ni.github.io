# HER2NI Interaction Telemetry Demo

This directory contains a minimal, static demonstration of HER2NI
interaction-level coherence telemetry.

The demo illustrates how coherence metrics (Cs, Ss, Hs) may evolve across
a short, step-indexed interaction sequence under mild perturbation.

This is a visual and conceptual reference only. It does not evaluate
model correctness, intent, or safety.
