# HER2NI Interaction Telemetry Demo

This directory contains a minimal, self-contained demonstration of
HER2NI interaction-level coherence telemetry.

The demo illustrates how coherence metrics (Cs, Ss, Hs) may evolve across
a short, step-indexed interaction sequence under a mild perturbation
between two agents.

The interface visualises:
- Interaction transcript excerpts
- Coherence bar indicators
- Step-indexed event descriptions

This demo is static and does not require a backend. All telemetry is
mocked for illustrative and research purposes.

**Important:**  
This demonstration does not evaluate model correctness, intelligence,
intent, or safety. It is an observational reference intended to support
research, evaluation, and human oversight.
