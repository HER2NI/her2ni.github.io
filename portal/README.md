# HER2NI Portal (Prototype)

This is a prototype UI demonstrating how HER2NI coherence metrics
(Cs, Ss, Hs) can be surfaced in real-time during human–AI interaction.

⚠️ This demo requires a local Node.js backend and is not a hosted service.

The purpose of this portal is to illustrate:
- interaction-level coherence instrumentation
- metric-driven feedback loops
- future-safe UI architecture

See the HER2NI protocol for formal specification.
